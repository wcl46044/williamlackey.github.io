	<h4> History of the Panthers</h4>
	<p>On October 26,1993 Jerry Richardson, a former NFL player founded the Carolina Panthers as the 29th NFL franchise. The team began to play in 1995, finishing with a record of 7-9, a solid start for a newborn program and an all time best for NFL expansion teams first season.
	Even better the following year the Panthers proceeded to win 12 games and lose only 4 games, which led them to winning he NFC South. However, per usual the Panthers went on to lose the NFC Championship game to the Super Bowl Champions, the Green Bay Packers.
	The Panthers went on to hit a dry spell and did not have a winning season again until 2003. This time the team was able to win the NFC Championship and move on to the Super Bowl. Again the Cardiac Cats held it to a close game against the New England Patriots but lost
	in the fourth quarter, 32-29. Following the 2003 Super Bowl lose they of course hit another downward spiral, only finding the playoffs in 2005 and 2008. In 2013 they qualified to make the playoffs, as well as win another NFC South title, the first of three consecutive conference titles.
	After losing in the divisional finals in both 2013 and 2014 the Panthers were finally able to break through and reach the Super Bowl in 2016. This year Cam Newton carried the team to a 15-1 record, shocking the Carolinas and much of the nation. As expected they reached the Super Bowl
	to face Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos. The Cardiac Cats struck again and the Panthers managed to lose to the Broncos in an agonizing defeat, that buried the hopes of Panthers fans. 
	<p>Following the exciting, but disappointing 2016 season the Carolina Panthers were looking to make another run at the title this season. After losing key cornerback Josh Norman to the Redskins, the secondary defense took a huge hit. The teams offense gained all star Kelvin Benjamin back after
	a blown out knee took him out last season. During the preseason analysis the Panthers were expected to have another stellar season. Little did every Panthers fan know, the Cardiac Cats would return and by week nine have a 3-6 record. The demise of the Panthers had come following the loss in the
	Super Bowl. The team had shocked the league and had yet to show the competitive drive and fight to win. Many ask what possibly could have happened in just a few short months, maybe the loss of Josh Norman? The loss of just one player should not change the outcome of the entire season. Looking back 
	the history of the Panthers clearly lays it all out. The Cardiac Cats have a path to follow as history shows. After both previous Super Bowl appearances, the teams had losing seasons with trials and tribulations. Hopefully as a fan, the Panthers will soon again find their groove in the next few seasons
	and we will see another rise to the top for the Panthers. If only the Carolina Panthers could learn from history, the fans would have a more reliable team, but then again they aren't the Cardiac Cats for no reason. </p>

<p> Over the years the Panther nation has seen high and low tides. Between the changing of coaches from John Fox to Ron Rivera as well as the 
the change of franchise quarterback from Jake Delhomme to the all new Cam Newton. The Cardiac Cats fan base has grown over the years, and as 
they finsih out their 2016 season, they hope to bring home a few more victories to the Carolinas. If you would like more information regarding
